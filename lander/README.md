# Lander

The Mars lander project was made up of 2 parts, one written in c++, the other in python.

The c++ part is made up mostly of a large skeleton code written by the Engineering Department, Univeristy of Cambridge,
with a few smaller additions by me to create the motion of the lander.

The python part is written by me, designed to show several orbital motions, showing the relative effectiveness of different numerical integrators.
