# Java Project 1

This project is based on a project written by a colleague, such that I could get to grips with 
writing in Java. It is an attempt at replicating Conway's Game of Life

Note: The project is not fully finished as I am currently in the process of creating the Game of 
Life class itself. Up until this point the game could be played through each of ArrayWorld and
PackedWorld separately, however this change aims to combine the two.
