# CUED Part IA Flood Warning System

This is the Part IA Lent Term computing activity at the Department of
Engineering, University of Cambridge.

These files are made up of the original CUED code, my code (~80%), and my project partner's code (~20%).

The activity is documented at
https://cued-partia-flood-warning.readthedocs.io/.
