# Integrated Design Project

The Integrated Design Project is a 4-week coursework activity where teams of 6
are expected to build and program a robot with eletrical components capable of 
detecting, collecting and safely depositing 'mines'.

This is the code, written by me, that the robot ran off (with added comments),
in the final competition.
